https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/feature_extraction.html#text-feature-extraction: "tokenizing strings and giving an integer id for each possible token, for instance by using white-spaces and punctuation as token separators."


The default regexp selects tokens of 2 or more alphanumeric characters (punctuation is completely ignored and always treated as a token separator).


SVM classifier can act as a validation signal on the preprocessing. we will try the best preprocessing pipeline with the NN later.
